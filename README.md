# Simupiano
This is an easy piano simulator programme using [**EasyX**](http://easyx.cn/) API.<br>
However it does not has 88 keys like an ordinary piano but **only 21 of them** including C-B, C<sub>1</sub>-B<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>-B<sub>2</sub>.<br><br>
You can play it by pressing the following keys on your keyboard:<br>
**'Q'-'U', 'A'-'J', 'Z'-'M' corresponding to C<sub>2</sub>-B<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>1</sub>-B<sub>1</sub>, C-B.<br>**
Fortunately you can now also see the notes falling down while playing. Other features are still under development.
